Hi! 

This is [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) made using javascript and [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

[Click here to start](https://andrydood.github.io/Game-of-Life-in-P5.JS/)

Click on the cells to make them alive, click again to kill them, press space to play

It's kind of glitchy sometimes, I'm guessing P5 is acting up
