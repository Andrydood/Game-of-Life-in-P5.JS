Hi! 

This is [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) made using javascript and [p5.js](https://p5js.org)

Just open index.html to start it

Click on the cells to make them alive, click again to kill them, press space to play

It's kind of glitchy sometimes, I'm guessing P5 is acting up
